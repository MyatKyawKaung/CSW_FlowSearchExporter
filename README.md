<h2 align="left"> CSW_FlowSearchExporter </h2>

* I created this tool to deal with millions of flow traffic results and alerts from Cisco StealthWatch with the help of ChatGPT :) <br>
* This tool efficiently extracts specific fields (source IP, source host group, target IP, target host group) from Cisco Stealthwatch flow search results and formats them into .txt format which makes it easier for me to present in a Powerpoint presentation.
## Installation
* Ensure Python3 is installed.<br>
* Run the script using..
```
python stealthwatch_data_extractor.py
```
